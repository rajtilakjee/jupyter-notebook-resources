# Jupyter Notebook resources.

## Introduction

Jupyter Notebook is a part of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). It is a web-based IDE which can be tried from your browser from the Project Jupyter website, and used after being installed locally. It offers an interactive, document-centric development environment, and can be used for creating and sharing computational documents. Jupyter Notebook supports 40+ programming languages including Python, Scala, R, and Julia.

The notebooks created using Jupyter Notebook can be shared via email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer. For producing rich interactive output, it supports HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types. With the help of Jupyter Notebook you can utilize big data tools like Apache Spark, from Python, R, and Scala. You can also explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, and TensorFlow.
